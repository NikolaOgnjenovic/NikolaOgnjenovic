<p align="center"> Hello! I'm Nikola, a young and aspiring student! </p>
🖥️ I am a high school student & software engineer currently hoping to study software engineering and constantly working on myself.

📖 I feel most comfortable with Android Studio & Java, as well as basic data structure & algorithm related problems and C++, but I also have basic knowledge of SQL, PHP, HTML,  CSS, JavaScript, as well as work experience related to system & network administration & tech support.

📥 You can contact me via Discord: Mrmi#5832

In my free time I love to work on myself, learn & experiment with new technologies, play video games, go outside, travel and much more...
